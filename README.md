## Description
This website was developed to function as a work planner. Each hour is able to hold three lines of text. Throughout the day the blocks will change on whether they have happened, are yet to happen, or currently happening. Saving your todos will store them locally so you can return to the page later.

## Installation

Visit the website at [https://lbissette.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/] or download the repository from my GitHub [https://github.com/LBissette?tab=repositories] and open the index.html to view
